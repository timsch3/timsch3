### Heyhey ðŸ‘‹
<br>

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a soon-to-be Web Developer attending the Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp by [Super-Code](https://super-code.de/) until November 2021

ðŸ“¡ Once finished I'd like to find a job where I'll be able to work remotely

ðŸŽ® I also love gaming and fiddle around with the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/) hoping to finish my idea for a 2D top-down space trading RPG at some point

ðŸŽ¹ And last but not least I'm a musician. Give it a listen if you like: [Tim Beau](https://soundcloud.com/timbeau/sets) (scroll the playlists for various styles)
