### Hey ðŸ‘‹
<br>

ðŸ’» I work remotely as a Web Developer, love building frontends using modern JS-based frameworks and (S)CSS but also have experience with PHP and MySQL.

ðŸŽ® Fiddling around with the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/) is another thing I enjoy.

ðŸŽ¹ And last but not least I make music: [Tim Beau](https://soundcloud.com/timbeau/sets) (scroll the playlists for various genres).
