### Heyhey ðŸ‘‹
<br>

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a soon-to-be Web Developer attending the Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp by [SuperCode](https://super-code.de/) until November 2021

ðŸ“¡ Once finished I'd like to find a job at a socially and environmentally responsible company where I'll be able to work remotely

ðŸŽ® I also love gaming and using the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/) to make 2D games

ðŸŽ¹ And last but not least I'm a musician. Give it a listen if you like: [Tim Beau](https://soundcloud.com/timbeau/sets) (scroll the playlists for various genres)
