### Heyhey 👋

🌱 I’m a Frontend Web Developer looking for a job at a socially and environmentally responsible company where I'll be able to work remotely

🎮 I also love gaming and fiddle around with the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/)

🎹 And last but not least I'm a musician. Give it a listen if you like: [Tim Beau](https://soundcloud.com/timbeau/sets) (scroll the playlists for various genres)
